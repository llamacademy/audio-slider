# Volume Sliders

Many of you have probably tried to create a slider that manages levels of audio for different things like Sound Effects or Music volume. 
However the most immediately obvious ways to approach this is very, very wrong.

Human perception of audio is not linear, like we'd like it to be from a coding standpoint. It's more logarithmic. In this video we'll take a look at 2 of the most common ways to approach audio sliders, then we'll look at the right way to do it. I'll also touch on how to save volume across runs of the game and how to set it up from the very launch of your game so your players can have their audio settings respected in all cases.
